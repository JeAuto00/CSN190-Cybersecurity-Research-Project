Pencode(2020)ffuf- payload encoding chain. Github
https://github.com/ffuf/pencode
Pencode is a tool that helps create payload encoding chains. It supports multiple encoding
schemes. Useful for obfuscating payloads in exploits or when bypassing filters. Often
included in Kali Linux or can be installed via Python. By encoding payloads in
Base64/URL/Hex, you can smuggle them through input filters and let the backend decode
them. This is also great for web exploitation, XSS bypasses, and command injection
evasion.
